# projects

The list contains all of the projects in the resume.

The project descriptions are as follows:

Indeed posts classifier:										        (ASU)  Jan-May 2020

•	Scraped data from indeed job postings using beautiful soup to train an NLP Classification model. 
•	Pre-processed data by removing stop words, punctuation, noise, etc.
•	Achieved a cross-validation score of 86 percent after grid search.
•	Classified data scraped per company to respective functional areas using the trained model.

Movie Recommendation Engine:								                      (ASU)  Aug-Dec 2019

•	Created a Recommendation model to suggest products to users and boost sales.
•	Trained the model using matrix factorization and content-based filtering to predict the user and movie vectors.
•	Tuned parameters using grid search and compared it with other ML models.
•	Evaluated the model with other trained models using RMSE values.
•	Built a UI to display recommended movies for the given movie.

Image Recommendation										       (ASU)  Aug-Dec 2019

•	Modeled an Image recommendation system to recommend similar users, images based on TF, DF, TF-IDF, and Global color histograms with the help of a NoSQL Database.
•	Reduced the dimensionality and used Mahalanobis distance to measure similarity. 
•	Built Clusters of similar images using Spectral and Normalize cut partition algorithm from an image-image graph.
•	Also, Visualized K- dominant Images based on input to generate relevant images using Personalized page ranking algorithm, Locality sensitive Hashing.

American Sign Language Recognition								       (ASU) Aug-May 2018

•	Engineered a Classification model to classify Sign Gestures based on video key point data generated.
•	Calibrated every frame in a gesture with its fixed points and used Feature selection techniques, FFT and DWT for frequency and temporal properties, and kept the features with most variance.
•	Achieved 84 percent classification accuracy and F1 score of 0.6 using a set of trained Neural networks on testing data 
among other models  Random forest, SVM, and logistic regression.
