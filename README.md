# projects
all Resume projects

The list contains all of the projects in the resume.

the project descriptions are as follows:

Image Recommendation										       (ASU)  Aug-Dec 2018
•	Modeled an Image recommendation system to recommend similar images based on TF, DF, TF-IDF and Global colour histograms. 
•	Reduced the dimensionality and used Cosine similarity, Euclidian and Mahalanobis distance to measure similarity. 
•	Built Clusters of similar images using Spectral and Normalize cut partition algorithm from image-image graph with k specified edges.
•	Visualized K- dominant Images based on input to generate relevant images using Personalized page ranking algorithm, Locality sensitive Hashing.

Product Recommendation Engine:								      (ASU)  May-Dec 2019
•	Created a Recommendation model to suggest products to Users and boost sales based on amazon dataset.
•	Trained the model using matrix factorization with gradient decent to predict the user and item vectors.
•	Built Sunburst and word cloud webpages for indexing and to describe products.
•	Recorded real time user data by populating the database based on purchase criteria to further train the model. 
•	Evaluated the model using Recall, mean average precision and RMSE and created a rest API using Flask and AWS.


American Sign Language Recognition:								       (ASU)  Jan-May 2019
•	Engineered a classification model to classify Sign Gestures based on video key point data generated.
•	Calibrated every frame in a gesture with its fixed points and used Feature selection techniques, FFT and DWT to filter out high, low frequency and for stretch out properties.
•	Achieved 84 percent classification accuracy and F1 score of 0.6 using a set of trained Neural networks and testing data respectively among other models like Random forest, SVM and logistic regression. 

User Movement Prediction:									       (ASU)  Jan-May 2019
•	Built a prediction model to infer user movement from sensor data.
•	Feature engineered by standardizing or power transforming depending on the algorithm as the data had some trends and gaussian like distribution and truncated data to fixed length.
•	Random forest, Decision tree, KNN, Gradient boosting, Support Vector Machine and Logistic regression models are used for algorithm spot check and achieved an accuracy of 69 percent on testing dataset with KNN-7. 
•	Also, when Auto feature learning model like LSTM was used, achieved an accuracy of 78 percent.
