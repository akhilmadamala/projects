# projects

The list contains all of the projects in the resume.

The project descriptions are as follows:

## Indeed posts classifier:										        (ASU)  Jan-May 2020<br/>
•	Scraped data from indeed job postings using beautiful soup to train an NLP Classification model. <br/>
•	Pre-processed data by removing stop words, punctuation, noise, etc.<br/>
•	Achieved a cross-validation score of 86 percent after grid search.<br/>
•	Classified data scraped per company to respective functional areas using the trained model.<br/>

## Movie Recommendation System:								        (ASU)  Aug-Dec 2019<br/>

•	Created a Recommendation model to suggest products to users and boost sales.<br/>
•	Trained the model using matrix factorization and content-based filtering to predict the user and movie vectors.<br/>
•	Tuned parameters using grid search and compared it with other ML models.<br/>
•	Evaluated the model with other trained models using RMSE values.<br/>
•	Built a UI to display recommended movies for the given movie.<br/>

## Image Recommendation										             (ASU)  Aug-Dec 2019<br/>

•	Modeled an Image recommendation system to recommend similar users, images based on TF, DF, TF-IDF, and Global color histograms with the help of a NoSQL Database.<br/>
•	Reduced the dimensionality and used Mahalanobis distance to measure similarity. <br/>
•	Built Clusters of similar images using Spectral and Normalize cut partition algorithm from an image-image graph.<br/>
•	Also, Visualized K- dominant Images based on input to generate relevant images using Personalized page ranking algorithm, Locality sensitive Hashing.<br/>

## American Sign Language Recognition								    (ASU) Aug-May 2018<br/>

•	Engineered a Classification model to classify Sign Gestures based on video key point data generated.<br/>
•	Calibrated every frame in a gesture with its fixed points and used Feature selection techniques, FFT and DWT for frequency and temporal properties, and kept the features with most variance.<br/>
•	Achieved 84 percent classification accuracy and F1 score of 0.6 using a set of trained Neural networks on testing data 
among other models  Random forest, SVM, and logistic regression. <br/>

## Amazon Analytics Website                             (ASU) Jan-May 2019<br/>
•	Pre-processed the amazon dataset and classified products based on catagories <br/>
• Used Apache Lucene to get information of top 10 products, positive and negative words for products etc.<br/>  
• Displayed the analytics using Sunburst, word cloud and bubble chart using interactive visualizations <br/>
• Hosted the website on AWS <br/>
